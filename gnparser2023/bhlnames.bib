abstract = {BHL has deployed a new taxonomic name finding tool to improve the speed and accuracy of identifying names throughout its 58+ million pages. BHL is now using Global Names Architecture's (GNA) gnfinder tool to locate taxonomic names in the BHL corpus. Prior to this deployment, BHL's name finding services were based on an index of scientific names created by GNA developers six years ago by parsing every page in BHL one by one. This took 45 days to accomplish, and the cost of repeating this process made updating or improving the index infeasible. The gnfinder tool uses fast, scalable programming languages to significantly reduce computational time. Using Open Source applications in Go and Scala, the tool detects candidate scientific names and compares them to millions of scientific name-strings aggregated by GNA for verification. The new process decreases the time needed for name detection and name verification from 35 days to 5 hours and from 7 days to 12 hours, respectively. As a result, the entire BHL corpus can now be indexed in less than a day, compared to the 45 days needed for the previous index. Additionally, by significantly reducing computational time, implementing iterative improvements to the index is now achievable. The accuracy of the names identified has also been improved with this deployment. By eliminating questionable results and false positives from the previous index, gnfinder produces a more accurate index of names in BHL. More than 34 million unique names — representing more than 239 million total instances of taxonomic name strings — were identified across the BHL corpus as of 21 July 2020. Of these, approximately 11.7 million are “Verified Names”, meaning they are unique names that have been resolved against a name authority (NameBank, Catalogue of Life, etc). The gnfinder tool was developed by Dmitry Mozzherin and Alexander Myltsev as part of GNA project work at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Mozzherin shared more about the process of developing this tool at the Biodiversity Next conference in Leiden, The Netherlands in 2019. Learn more in the presentation slides. You can learn more about how the BHL implementation of the gnfinder tool works in our FAQ. We would like to thank our colleagues at Global Names Architecture — especially Dmitry Mozzherin, Alexander Myltsev, and David Patterson — for their work to develop these tools. Thanks also to Joel Richard (BHL Technical Coordinator and Head of Web Services and IT at Smithsonian Libraries) and Mike Lichtenberg (BHL Lead Developer) for their work to deploy gnfinder on the BHL website. If you have questions about gnfinder or would like to provide feedback or suggestions, please contact Global Names Architecture via the Global Names BHL project on GitHub. Global Names development on BHL indexing is supported by National Science Foundation grants #1356347 and #1645959 as well as the Species File Group at the University of Illinois.},

Long-planned improvements in the use of persistent identifiers were pushed to the forefront of technical development. Improvements to the data model and user interface to better support born-digital content and articles were also prioritized in the 2021 Technical Priorities. Back-end improvements to the BHL website, currently under development, will also facilitate easier metadata import and updates, making it faster and easier to add article-level metadata, which will improve search and discoverability for articles within the collection.

abstract = {1. The process of standardizing taxa names, taxonomic name harmonization, is necessary to properly merge data indexed by taxon names. The large variety of taxonomic databases and related tools are often not well described. It is often unclear which databases are actively maintained or what is the original source of taxonomic information. In addition, software to access these databases is developed following non-compatible standards, which creates additional challenges for users. As a result, taxonomic harmonization has become a major obstacle in ecological studies that seek to combine multiple datasets. 2. Here, we review and categorize a set of major taxonomic databases publicly available as well as a large collection of R packages to access them and to harmonize lists of taxa names. We categorized available taxonomic databases according to their taxonomic breadth (e.g. taxon-specific vs multi-taxa) and spatial scope (e.g. regional vs global), highlighting strengths and caveats of each type of database. We divided R packages according to their function, (e.g. syntax standardization tools, access to online databases, etc.) and highlighted overlaps among them. We present our findings (e.g. network of linkages, data and tool characteristics) in a ready-to-use Shiny web application (available at: https://mgrenie.shinyapps.io/taxharmonizexplorer/). 3. We also provide general guidelines and best practice principles for taxonomic name harmonization. As an illustrative example, we harmonized taxon names of one of the largest databases of community time series currently available. We showed how different workflows can be used for different goals, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses and providing practical solutions to avoid common pitfalls. 4. To our knowledge, our opinionated review represents the most exhaustive evaluation of links among and of taxonomic databases and related R tools. Finally, based on our new insights in the field, we make recommendations for users, database managers, and package developers alike.},

Eight BHL partners work with institutions within their global regions building capacity for digitization and promoting open access for biodiversity literature. The BHL was created in 2006 as a direct response to the needs of the taxonomic community for access to early literature. The original BHL organizational model, based on United States and United Kingdom partners, provided a template for a series of global partners, including the BHL China partner based at the Institute of Botany (CAS) in Beijing. Most recently, additional global partnerships were formed as BHL Africa, BHL Singapore, and BHL Mexico. Built around widely adopted standards, BHL prescribes metadata and scanning specifications for contributing libraries. Yet even with standards and guidelines, variations in interpretation of standards along with locally implemented practices can benefit from well-defined workflows and tool-suites. BHL and its global partners tailor workflows to local practices through workshops covering a range of practical considerations, including rights policies, terms of agreements, specifications for digitization, and workflows. Moving the project to a cornerstone of biodiversity infrastructure, sustainability, appropriate expansion, collaboration with national and pan-national digital libraries (Europeana, the Digital Public Library of America) became more important.

abstract = {The recognition of taxonomic entities plays a key role for natural language pro- cessing and understanding in botanical contexts. Automating knowledge and entity extraction is hence a core endeavor for populating and enriching existing knowledge bases and for digitally interlinking scientific and ethnobotanical plant knowledge. In this work, we present a semi-supervised approach for the automatic recognition of plant names in their Latin and vernacular variants in German and English across different text genres. For this purpose, we compiled four corpora differing in terms of formality (scientific vs. non-scientific), writing style (blog articles vs. introductory Wikipedia sections), and publication period (historical vs. recent). Our proposed pipeline includes linguistic preprocessing based on sentence splitting, tokenization, and part-of-speech tagging. Additionally, we use dictionary-based annotations to automatically label the corpus data and create a low-effort silver standard. The dictionary lookups rely on large language-specific gazetteers for a total of nine hi- erarchical scientific and vernacular entity labels collected from several botanical re- sources. Subsequently, we train a state-of-the-art named entity recognition (NER) system based on a bidirectional long-short-term-memory architecture [Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997] followed by a conditional random field layer (bi-LSTM- CRF) [Lample et al., 2016]. To exploit token-level and character-level contextual information from the silver-labeled datasets, we integrate the 300-dimensional pre- trained FastText word embeddings [Grave et al., 2018] and re-train character-level word representations on the input data [Lample et al., 2016]. In total, we generate eight neural models per language and dataset. An evaluation of the entity tagger shows F1-scores of >86% on both manually and automatically annotated test sets for the combined English dataset. For German, we report a final F1-score of >94% on both annotation types. We discuss the insights gained from adopting several dataset and language-specific parameter combinations from a single and cross-dataset eval- uation perspective. Finally, we disambiguate the entity candidates proposed by the tagging system and link them to an international botanical reference database using a lookup table for the vernacular names. Our approach emphasizes the potential of fine-grained, domain-specific entity labels and low-effort data models trained on automatically labeled corpus data to explore and computationally process lower- resourced fields and genres for knowledge preservation purposes.},

However variations in spelling of scientific names greatly diminish their ability to interconnect data. Such variations may include abbreviations, annotations, misspellings, etc. Authorship is a part of a scientific name and may also differ significantly. To match all possible variations of a name we need to divide them into their elements and classify each element according to its role. We refer to this as ‘parsing' the name. Parsing categorizes name's elements into those that are stable and those that are prone to change. Names are matched first by combining them according to their stable elements. Matches are then refined by examining their varying elements. This two stage process dramatically improves the number and quality of matches. It is especially useful for the automatic data exchange within the context of “Big Data” in biology.},

abstract = {The most significant specialized and open resource for biodiversity literature is the Biodiversity Heritage Library (BHL). BHL contains more than 200,000 volumes that cover hundreds of years of biological publications. The Catalogue of Life (CoL) is the largest aggregator of global taxonomic information. The Global Names project collaborates with BHL and CoL to create a BHL scientific names index that is continuously improved. The index allows researchers to conveniently find relevant information about any name. Building a scientific names index is challenging because scientific names are quite dynamic and can dramatically change in taxonomic meaning over time. According to our estimates, on average, there are three scientific names per species. Also, a significant number of scientific names have fallen into disuse. For example, approximately 25% of names used in Zoology between 1750–1850 and collected by Charles Sherborn into Index Animalium disappeared from current nomenclatural and taxonomic databases. It is important, therefore, to add "taxonomic intelligence" to BHL names index search and present not only data about a specific name-string but also about all known synonyms so that all relevant information in BHL can be consolidated and conveniently accessed from taxonomic information aggregators like CoL. We developed an open source program "bhlnames", which creates a two-way bridge between the Catalogue of Life and Biodiversity Heritage Library. It provides the location of information in BHL about a taxon, using all names associated with the taxon according to Catalogue of Life synonymy data.

@article{Ower2021,
abstract = {Being able to quickly find and access original species descriptions is essential for efficiently conducting taxonomic research. Linking scientific name queries to the original species description is challenging and requires taxonomic intelligence because on average there are an estimated three scientific names associated with each currently accepted species, and many historical scientific names have fallen into disuse from being synonymized or forgotten. Additionally, non-standard usage of journal abbreviations can make it difficult to automatically disambiguate bibliographic citations and ascribe them to the correct publication. The largest open access resource for biodiversity literature is the Biodiversity Heritage Library (BHL), which was built by a consortium of natural history institutions and contains over 200,000 digitized volumes of natural history publications spanning hundreds of years of biological research. Catalogue of Life (CoL) is the largest aggregator of scientific names globally, publishing an annual checklist of currently accepted scientific names and their historical synonyms. TaxonWorks is an integrative web-based workbench that facilitates collaboration on biodiversity informatics research between scientists and developers. The Global Names project has been collaborating with BHL, TaxonWorks, and CoL to develop a Global Names Index that links all of these services together by finding scientific names in BHL and using the taxonomic intelligence provided by CoL to conveniently link directly to the page referenced in BHL. The Global Names Index is continuously updated as metadata is improved and digitization technologies advance to provide more accurate optical character recognition (OCR) of scanned texts. We developed an open source tool, “BHLnames,” and launched a restful application programming interface (API) service with a freely available Javascript widget that can be embedded on any website to link scientific names to literature citations in BHL. If no bibliographic citation is provided, the widget will link to the oldest name usage in BHL, which often is the original species description. The BHLnames widget can also be used to browse all mentions of a scientific name and its synonyms in BHL, which could make the tool more broadly useful for studying the natural history of any species.},

This article examines the needs of users of taxonomic literature, specifically in relation to the transformation of traditional library material to digital form. It details the issues that arise in determining scanning priorities, avoiding duplication of scanning across the founding 12 natural history and botanical garden library collections, and the problems related to the complexity of serials, monographs, and series. Highlighted are the tools, procedures, and methodology for addressing the details of a mass-scanning operation. Specifically, keeping a steady flow of material, creation of page level metadata, and building services on top of data and metadata that meet the needs of the targeted communities. The replication of the BHL model across a number of related projects in China, Brazil, and Australia are documented as evidence of the success of the BHL mass-scanning project plan.},

abstract = {The Global Names Project held a workshop on 17-19 June 2019 on the Campus of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. The workshop was titled Scientific names indexing and data mobilization of Biodiversity Heritage Library using tools from Global Names project and was hosted by the Species File Group at the Illinois Natural History Survey. Eighteen people attended representing a variety of organizations interested in BHL content: Global Names Architecture, iDigBio, TaxonWorks, UIUC Species File Group, the Illinois Library, Encyclopedia of Life, the DINA Project, the Catalogue of Life, GBIF, Species File Group Argentina, the HathiTrust Research Center, and Global Biotic Interactions. The workshop was organized as an unconference/hackathon in which the meeting is planned by all participants at the workshop. We initially all proposed topics we individually were interested in exploring; these were our “selfish goals”. In an exercise at the workshop, those goals were broken into similar or related topics. The most popular topics (see those sticky notes on the wall — in the background of the photo) became the focus of “pitches”, i.e. challenges that we could address at the workshop. We self-organized into working groups under the banner of pitch and got to work. Note that at a hackathon, the goal is that you are always either “doing or learning.” For example, some of us learned how to mine BHL content using the Developer and Data Tools. And if you'd like to try it, you too can install and use the gnfinder and gnparser tools. The gnparser tool breaks scientific name-strings into the semantic elements of the string. While gnfinder searches text output (like OCR) for names. Overall, the activities of the workshop centered around further improving the information that we can extract from the OCR (optical character recognition) content that is generated from the page images in BHL, including improving that OCR content itself. One group focused on attempting to find Species Identification Keys in BHL. Using a versioned, citable, and verifiable snapshot of the BHL OCR text corpus1, the group discovered that a variety of ways in which a species identification key is labeled in the text combined with the natural inaccuracies of OCR make the task of identifying a heading for a key challenging2. Another group worked on connecting the APIs of TaxonWorks, Global Names, and BHL. Their goal was to integrate information and resources from all three in a single interface that highlighted the BHL pages that species were originally described on. This group managed to wrap all three APIs in a single place (a “Task” in TaxonWorks), but problems with matching citation data across platforms prevented them from truly “closing the loop”. Finally, the largest group focused on extracting different entities from the OCR content of the BHL, for example geographic names, people names, and organizations. This group experimented with a variety of natural language techniques and tools including the Edinburgh Geoparser, IBM Watson, Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services, and LingPipe and identified some additional challenges to extracting such entities from BHL. Not surprisingly, there is some overlap between place names and taxon names. For example, “St. Lucia” can be conflated with the genus “Lucia” (a type of butterfly), which certainly adds a hurdle for accurate entity identification. The results of the workshop are being integrated into a Wiki that contains our initial goals and that invites other stakeholders to get involved. One direct outcome of the workshop is that the BHL will move to provide quarterly exports of the OCR, available to anyone, to mine and experiment with. Previously, this content was not easily downloadable. The workshop discussions and hacking drove home the point that this corpus is a key element for future developments. Many other broader topics were also raised throughout the meeting. In particular, we explored the idea of opening a worldwide biodiversity informatics channel to better facilitate communication and share ideas among interested parties in real-time. This could be done using Slack. Many thanks to the Global Names and the Illinois Natural History Survey for hosting, and especially Dima Mozzherin for all of his work on the Global Names Name Finding algorithm, which has opened the door to moving BHL's content into the next decade.},

abstract = {Hymenoptera, the insect order that includes sawflies, bees, wasps, and ants, exhibits an incredible diversity of phenotypes, with over 145,000 species described in a corpus of textual knowledge since Carolus Linnaeus. In the absence of specialized training, often spanning decades, however, these articles can be challenging to decipher. Much of the vocabulary is domain-specific (e.g., Hymenoptera biology), historically without a comprehensive glossary, and contains much homonymous and synonymous terminology. The Hymenoptera Anatomy Ontology was developed to surmount this challenge and to aid future communication related to hymenopteran anatomy, as well as provide support for domain experts so they may actively benefit from the anatomy ontology development. As part of HAO development, an active learning, dictionary-based, natural language recognition tool was implemented to facilitate Hymenoptera anatomy term discovery in literature. We present this tool, referred to as the ‘Proofer', as part of an iterative approach to growing phenotype-relevant ontologies, regardless of domain. The process of ontology development results in a critical mass of terms that is applied as a filter to the source collection of articles in order to reveal term occurrence and biases in natural language species descriptions. Our results indicate that taxonomists use domain-specific terminology that follows taxonomic specialization, particularly at superfamily and family level groupings and that the developed Proofer tool is effective for term discovery, facilitating ontology construction.},
