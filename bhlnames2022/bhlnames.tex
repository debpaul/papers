The Catalogue of Life (CoL) project was established in 2000 with the
goal of developing a global checklist of all species {[}Bisby2000{]}. As
of this writing, CoL contains over 2 million species with 1.6 million
synonyms. CoL additionally has 1.6 million synonym names, which enables
finding species using either the currently accepted scientific name or
historical names. For example, synonyms can result from species being
moved to a different genus, or duplicate descriptions of the same taxon
being resolved. Of the 3.7 million scientific names in CoL, only XXX\%
have nomenclatural references to the species description in the
literature.

Biodiversity Heritage Library (BHL) is the largest open access
collection of biodiversity literature. BHL was founded in 2006 and is
goverened by an internetional consortium. BHL currently comprises of 270
thousand volumes and 60 million pages of biodiversity texts. By far the
best way to discover biodiversity information in BHL is by searching for
scintific names of organisms. The index of scientific names for BHL is
created by Global Names Architecture (GNA) project.

The purpose of GNA is creation of services and tools that allow to
globally connect biodiversity information and research via scientific
names. GNA was founded in 2007 and includes nomenclatural (ZooBank, a
zoological names registrator) and lexical tools (GNparser, GNverifier,
GNfinder). GNfinder detects scientific names in texts. GNparser
normalizes scientific name-strings and extracts semantic meanings of
their components. Normalised scientific names allow to aggregate lexical
variants of a name into a lexical group. GNverifier allows to search a
name-string of interest in more than 100 sources of biodiversity data.
GNverifier uses data from Catalogue of Life, Encyclopedia of Life, Index
Fungorum, Global Biodiversity Information Facility and many others. GNA
tools are used for creation of scientific name index in BHL.

The BHL index of scientific names is created by processing BHL data
through BHLindex, yet another GNA tool. BHLindex breaks each volume in
BHL into tokens (words). Then it scans the tokens and uses heuristic and
natural language processing algorithms of GNfinder to detect possible
scientific names. Later these names are verified (reconciled and
resolved) via GNverifier. The process is quite fast and allows to
process 60 millions of BHL pages in about 12 hours on a modern laptop.
The efficiency of the index creation allows to incrementally improve
algorithms and quality of the name-finding. GNverifier also provides
metadata for each volume, calculating its biological ``context''. Such
information includes the kingdom which contains most of the names found
in a volume, as well as the lowest clade that contains more than half of
the volume' names. The calculation uses managerial classification of the
Catalogue of Life.

Searching BHL for a particular name in the name index would often miss a
significant amount of data because taxons' names do change with time.
CoL currently contains \textasciitilde4 million names, for
\textasciitilde2 million taxons. The database of GNverifier contains 8
million canonical forms, for \textasciitilde2.5 million known taxons.
From this data we can estimate that there are 2-3 names per a taxon on
average. It means that to get more comprehensive data about species it
is important to search not only by one name, but by all names used for
the species historically.

Another way to aquire information from BHL is by searching for a
particular paper. Thanks to BioStore effort metainformation and location
is known for 200 000? papers in BHL. However to find a paper by a
citation is still hard, especially automatically by a script. There is a
large variety of lexical variants for every journal name (FIG). Format
of data about the year of publication, a journal volume, pages differs
from one citation to the next. It is much easier to search for a year,
volume and page data as numbers, but in BHL such metadata is stored as a
string and is not consistent throghout the corpus. Quite often such
metadata is missing, or contains mistakes and it makes the search
harder.

TODO: Fig: examples of journal name different spellings

If a researcher has a citation of a nomenclatural event and tries to
find the paper with original description of species, it is often not a
trivial task. Citations are hard to match to pages in BHL as described
above. Sometimes OCR errors change a name spelling and as a result exist
in a volume under different spelling variants. Quite often people add an
annotation next to new species or combination, such as sp.nov, comb nov.

However such annotations are not consistent (FIG), and also often
modified by OCR. When several species of the same genus are described,
the genus in the name is often abbreviated, which also masks the name
from a researcher.

TODO: Fig: examples for annotations

The project we describe in this paper helps to adress these problems
with the following solutions. BHLnames uses name index, CoL data, and
BHL metadata together to improve search of an information connected to a
name-string, match a citation to a page in BHL, find pages that contain
original descriptions of species.. BHLnames uses CoL synonymy data to
optionally expand name search to all its synonyms. BHLnames normalizes
BHL data for publication years and pages, making it easier to compare it
with numeric representations of years and pages. The project uses 2?
million citations of nomenclatural events for names in CoL to provide
data about nomenclatural events. BHLnames normalizes journal names in a
citation and BHL to match them together. We use Naive Bayes approach to
calculate probabilities of a citation to a BHL page match and return the
best results. Such results are provided via Dryad (Link)

\hypertarget{goals}{%
\subsection{Goals}\label{goals}}

The goals of BHLnames project are:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Provide an ability to search for a citation in BHL using citation
  metadata and the index of names data.

  Use names' index information to dramatically simplify search for a
  publication. Combine citation metadata together with occurences of a
  name to point to possible pages of a citation with high probability.
\item
  Discover original descriptions and nomenclatural events in BHL.

  Use the goal \#1 together with citation and name information from CoL.
  Combine these data to determine pages containing nomenclatural events
  for scientific names. Increase usability of BHL for biodiversity
  reseearchers by augmenting scientific names index with the
  nomenclatural events index.
\item
  Add ``taxonomic intalligence'' to the BHL's index of scientific names.

  Use goal \#2 and the CoL data to optionally expand BHL name search
  with taxonomical information. Return data not only for a particular
  name, but for its synonyms. Provide data about currently accepted name
  for the taxa. Also, when available, provide data about nomenclatural
  events for all relevant names.
\end{enumerate}

(Methods)

\hypertarget{technical-introduction}{%
\subsection{Technical introduction}\label{technical-introduction}}

BHLnames an Open Source project written in Go and JavaScript. It can be
used independently by anybody with Internet connection and a write
access to a PostgreSQL database. It consists of one stand-alone file and
requires no additional dynamic libraries. The file can be downloaded at
(GitHub link)

BHLnames requires a substantial initialization stage. After
initialization it can be used in off-line mode.

\hypertarget{architecture}{%
\subsection{Architecture}\label{architecture}}

BHLnames' code structure mostly uses Clean Architecture principles for
organisation of its modules. The main use-case functinality is defined
in an in an interface (Link?).

The core (entity) modules that do not require I/O interactions with a
database, internet or local storate, are located in `ent' directory. The
`ent' directory also contains interfaces implemented by modules that
need I/O access. Such approach uncouples core modules from particular
implementations of external I/O processes and provides flexibility for
changing ways of storing and accessing the data.

The modules that require access to database, internet, interfaces to
users, accesses to frameworks implement entity interfaces and depend on
the main use-case interface for providing functionality of BHLnames. One
exception to this rule is `bhlnames' directory that contains
command-line interface to the project.

There are 3 different kinds of user-interfaces:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Command-line application starts and stops the web-service or provides
  BHLnames functionality via terminal window.
\item
  RESTful API provides endpoints for remote access to BHLnames
  functionality via HTTP calls.
\item
  Web-interface allows remote interactive access BHLnames users via
  Internet.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{dependencies}{%
\subsubsection{Dependencies}\label{dependencies}}

Initialization phase of the projct requires a remote access to remote
data-dump of BHL located at (LINK). Also it needs an access to a RESTful
inteface of BHLindex application.

BHLindex is an Open Source application written in Go that creates
scientific names index of BHL. The application scans BHL's 60 million
pages, detects scientific names and provides data about their occurences
via RESTful interface. It is possible to use publicly available URL that
serves BHLindex API at (LINK).

There are many dependencies on Go modules, some of them written
specifically for Global Names project. We will talk about some of GN
modules further. Go dependencies are required only during the
compilation of the project and are not needed for running BHLnames
service or command-line application.
